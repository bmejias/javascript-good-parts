Just learning JavaScript
========================

This repository is just a collection of exercises I'm writing to lear better
JavaScript, mostly by reading the book "JavaScript: The Good Parts", by Douglas
Crockford.

So, it's not a project that provides any functionality. It's just handy to me to
have a repository to keep all these exercises.

I'm running the exercises with Node.js, I just noticed that Rhino might have
been an option too, but then all the outputs to the console should have been
``print`` instead of ``console.log``.
