Just learning JavaScript
========================

This repository is just a collection of exercises I'm writing to better learn
JavaScript, mostly by reading the book "JavaScript: The Good Parts", by Douglas
Crockford.

So, it's not a project that provides any functionality. It's just very handy to
have a repository to keep all these exercises.
